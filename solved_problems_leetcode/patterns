# üöÄ Core Patterns to Master for Google Interviews (And Beyond)

### 1. **Sliding Window**

**Key:** Manage a dynamic range efficiently (fixed or variable size) for problems on substrings/subarrays.
**Why:** Often used for strings and arrays; fast O(n) solutions instead of brute force.

### 2. **Two Pointers**

**Key:** Use two indices moving through data, often sorted, to find pairs or process sequences in linear time.
**Why:** Great for sorted data, arrays, and string manipulation problems.

### 3. **Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum**

**Key:** Precompute sums to answer range queries in O(1).
**Why:** Speeds up repeated sum or frequency computations.

### 4. **Binary Search**

**Key:** Efficiently search in sorted arrays or answer spaces by halving search range.
**Why:** Essential for optimized search problems and tricky ‚Äúsearch in answer space‚Äù questions.

### 5. **Greedy Algorithms**

**Key:** Make local optimal choices to build global solution.
**Why:** Simplicity and efficiency; sometimes tricky to prove correctness.

### 6. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

**Key:** Break problems into subproblems with overlapping solutions; use memoization or tabulation.
**Why:** Critical for optimization and combinatorial problems.

### 7. **Min/Max Tracking**

**Key:** Track minimum or maximum element seen so far to compute differences or maintain constraints.
**Why:** Core to problems like stock trading, max difference, and real-time stats.

### 8. **Monotonic Stack/Queue**

**Key:** Maintain increasing or decreasing sequences for range or next greater element queries.
**Why:** Efficient for histogram, sliding window max, and related problems.

### 9. **Heap / Priority Queue**

**Key:** Maintain top-K elements dynamically or get min/max efficiently.
**Why:** Useful for merging, scheduling, or any dynamic ordering problem.

### 10. **Union Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**

**Key:** Quickly track and merge connected components.
**Why:** Vital for connectivity, cycle detection, and clustering problems.

### 11. **Topological Sort**

**Key:** Order nodes respecting dependencies in DAGs.
**Why:** Key in scheduling, build systems, and prerequisite resolution.

### 12. **Backtracking**

**Key:** Explore all options systematically, pruning invalid branches.
**Why:** Essential for combinatorial, permutation, and constraint satisfaction problems.

### 13. **Divide and Conquer**

**Key:** Recursively split problems into smaller independent parts and combine results.
**Why:** Foundational for efficient sorting, searching, and many recursive algorithms.

### 14. **Reservoir Sampling**

**Key:** Uniformly sample k elements from unknown or streaming data with O(k) space.
**Why:** Powerful for big data and streaming scenarios.

### 15. **Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)**

**Key:** Detect cycles in linked lists or sequences with two pointers moving at different speeds.
**Why:** Elegant solution to cycle problems without extra space.

### 16. **Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm**

**Key:** Find max sum subarray by tracking running sums and resetting when negative.
**Why:** Classic for max subarray problems; O(n) solution.

### 17. **Meet in the Middle**

**Key:** Split problem, solve halves independently, combine results to reduce exponential complexity.
**Why:** Useful for hard subset-sum, combination, and exponential problems.

### 18. **Bit Manipulation**

**Key:** Use bitwise operations to solve set, toggling, and counting problems efficiently.
**Why:** Critical for optimization and certain mathematical problems.

### 19. **Graph Traversals (DFS & BFS)**

**Key:** Explore nodes and edges to solve pathfinding, connectivity, and shortest path.
**Why:** Core to graph problems, often combined with other patterns.

### 20. **Sliding Window Maximum (Deque or Heap)**

**Key:** Efficiently find max/min in a sliding window.
**Why:** Combines sliding window and data structure skills.
