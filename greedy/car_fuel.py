ðŸ§­ **Greedy Challenge â€“ Intermediate+**

> **Problem:**
> There is a car that can travel **at most `fuel` kilometers** with a full tank.
> You are given a list of **`stations[] = [(dist_from_start, fuel_available)]`**, sorted by distance from the start.
> You start at position `0` with **0 fuel**.
> You can **refuel at any station**, and **each refueling takes time** (but doesnâ€™t affect fuel capacity).
> Return the **minimum number of refueling stops** needed to reach a target distance.
> If it's impossible, return `-1`.

---

### ðŸ”§ Example:

```python
target = 100
startFuel = 10
stations = [(10, 60), (20, 30), (30, 30), (60, 40)]
# Output: 2 (Refuel at 10 and 60)
```

---

### ðŸ“¦ Constraints:

* All distances and fuel amounts are positive integers.
* `stations` is sorted by distance.
* Target â‰¤ 10^6, len(stations) â‰¤ 10^4
* You must minimize refuel **count**, not amount.

---

ðŸ”’ Donâ€™t give final code yet.
Start by explaining:

1. What makes this greedy?
2. Why naive greedy may fail?
3. Then build strategy.

Keep answers in 2-line mode. Iâ€™ll respond accordingly.
