ðŸ§© Greedy Interview Question #2: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
You are given an array of intervals where each interval represents the horizontal diameter of a balloon.
An arrow can be shot vertically and bursts all balloons that intersect that line.

ðŸ”¹ Input:
points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]

ðŸ”¹ Output:
2

ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
You need to shoot the minimum number of arrows such that every balloon is burst.

One arrow can burst all balloons that overlap with its vertical path.

Constraints:
1 <= len(points) <= 10^5

points[i] = [start, end] with start <= end

No guarantee that points are sorted

All values are integers, no floats

Multiple intervals can be fully overlapping

    for start, end in arr[1:]:
        if prev < start:
            count+=1
            prev = end

    return count

print(burst([[1, 6], [2, 8], [7, 12], [10, 16]]))
