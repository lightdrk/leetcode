Great question â€” you're right to double-check! Letâ€™s break it down clearly:

---

## âœ… **Beginner-Friendly Greedy Problems (Truly for Starters):**

These are **absolutely beginner** level. You should start here if you're new to greedy algorithms:

1. **Coin Change (Greedy)** â€“ \[Standard coin denominations]

   > Very basic, direct greedy strategy.
   > âœ… Beginner

2. **Activity Selection Problem**

   > Classic greedy: Sort by end time, pick next non-overlapping.
   > âœ… Beginner

3. **Assign Cookies**

   > Simple greedy based on sorting.
   > âœ… Beginner

4. **Reduce Array to 0 by Subtracting Distinct Elements**

   > Just find the number of unique positive elements.
   > âœ… Beginner (though it sounds tricky)

## ğŸŸ¡ **Low-Intermediate Greedy Problems:**

These are a bit more involved but still approachable for motivated beginners:

5. **Fractional Knapsack**

   > Sort by value/weight ratio. A classic greedy problem.
   > ğŸŸ¡ Low-intermediate (requires understanding sorting + partial choices)

6. **Minimum Number of Platforms**

   > Conceptually easy but needs careful handling of sorting.
   > ğŸŸ¡ Low-intermediate

7. **Jump Game (Min Jumps)**

   > Can be solved greedily, but logic needs attention.
   > ğŸŸ¡ Low-intermediate

## ğŸ”¸ **Intermediate Greedy Problems:**

These require a bit more experience with arrays, sorting, and edge cases:

8. **Job Sequencing Problem**

   > Needs sorting and a time-slot booking approach.
   > ğŸ”¸ Intermediate

9. **Gas Station (Circular Route)**

   > Needs full traversal logic and careful prefix sum handling.
   > ğŸ”¸ Intermediate

10. **Custom Coin Change (like \[1, 3, 4])**

> Great **greedy vs dynamic programming** contrast.
> ğŸ”¸ Intermediate (teaches greedy limits)

## ğŸ‘‰ Recommendation:

If you are just starting out, do the first **3â€“4 problems** from the âœ… beginner section. Once you're comfortable, move to the ğŸŸ¡ ones.

Want me to reorder and label a list with just **true beginner greedy problems** to get started with?
