ğŸ’¼ Meeting Rooms II
You are given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i].

Each interval represents a meeting with a start and end time.

ğŸ”¸ Your task: Return the minimum number of meeting rooms required so that no meetings overlap in the same room.

ğŸ§  Example:
python

Edit
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
Explanation:

Meeting 1: 0 to 30

Meeting 2: 5 to 10 (overlaps with Meeting 1)

Meeting 3: 15 to 20 (also overlaps with Meeting 1)

At most, 2 meetings overlap at the same time, so we need 2 rooms.
