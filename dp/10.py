'''
Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

here i will do something like this if we have * i will use for loop for s till i find the value 
not similar to previous and then move both by one 

on getting . i will move simply by one as . is equal to any value ..
now what will i do with .* if this comes i will just check if their are any value after .* as anything will be true 
if we only have .* it will be true and if it starts with char then till we get to this .* we will move and if we have anything in last then
that mean last should be equal
