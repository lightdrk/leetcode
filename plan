Ah — got it! You're not a total beginner — you're a **"fresher, but experienced in DSA"** — someone who’s done most core topics already and is now **refining, optimizing, and deepening** for interviews like **Google**.

Perfect. That means you're in the **“refinement and mastery” phase**, not discovery.

Let’s shift focus accordingly.

## 🔥 DSA Mastery Roadmap (Fresher but Already Covered Core)

### 🎯 Goal: Deepen understanding, eliminate weak spots, practice Google-style problems, and build pattern fluency.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Tighten Core Fundamentals (1 week max)

You're not relearning — you're solidifying. For each topic below, **implement + solve 2–3 handpicked advanced questions**.

| Topic            | Focus Now                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arrays & Strings | Do problems with constraints (O(1) space, in-place mod)      |
| Hashing          | Optimize collision-prone cases; revisit hashmap tricks       |
| Stack & Queue    | Monotonic stacks, infix → postfix conversion                 |
| Linked Lists     | Complex ones like LFU Cache, intersection, K-group reverse   |
| Sliding Window   | Variable size, dynamic windows, max in window                |
| Two Pointers     | Tricky variants (3Sum Closest, Merge Sorted Arrays in-place) |

### ✅ Phase 2: Intermediate → Advanced Focus Areas

You've probably **done** these topics — now focus on:

* **Edge case handling**
* **Custom modifications**
* **Variants that combine multiple topics**

#### 🔁 Sorting & Searching

* **Binary Search on Answer**

  * Min days to make bouquets
  * Koko eating bananas
* **QuickSelect**

  * Kth smallest in unsorted array
* Bucket sort / radix in practice

#### 🌲 Trees

* **Binary Tree:**

  * Serialize/deserialize
  * Build from preorder + inorder
  * Views: left/right/top
* **BST:**

  * Recover BST
  * In-order successor without recursion

#### 📊 Heaps & Priority Queues

* Top K frequent elements
* Median from data stream
* Merge K sorted lists

#### 📚 Tries

* Prefix matching
* Word suggestions (Google-style)
* Bitwise trie for max XOR pair

#### 🔄 Graphs

* BFS & DFS with visited set edge cases
* Union Find with path compression
* Topo sort: DFS & Kahn’s
* Dijkstra’s (heap), Bellman-Ford (neg edges)
* Detect cycle in directed graph
* Problems like:

  * Course Schedule
  * Number of islands (BFS/DFS/Union Find)

### ✅ Phase 3: Dynamic Programming Mastery

Forget "just doing DP" — aim to **recognize patterns instantly**.

| DP Pattern  | Key Problems                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1D DP       | Climb stairs, House robber, Jump game                          |
| 2D DP       | LCS, Edit Distance, Unique paths                               |
| Knapsack    | 0/1, unbounded, partition subset                               |
| Substrings  | Longest Palindromic Substring, Substring with K distinct chars |
| DP on Trees | Max path sum, camera on binary tree                            |
| Bitmask DP  | Count subsets, Traveling Salesman Problem (optional)           |

👉 **Practice writing both memoized + tabulated versions.**

### ✅ Phase 4: Google-Level + System Design Lite

These aren’t just about solving — they test **real-world thinking**.

| Area           | Problems                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Greedy         | Jump Game II, Gas Station, Reorganize String           |
| Backtracking   | N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Word Search                   |
| Tricky Design  | LRU/LFU Cache, File System class, Hit Counter          |
| Streaming      | Moving average from stream, sliding window median      |
| Graph + DP Mix | Word Ladder II, Alien Dictionary, Shortest path in DAG |

---

### 🎯 Phase 5: Interview Simulation & Practice

You've done the study. Now it's about performance.

* ✅ **LeetCode Contest archives** → for timed practice
* ✅ **Pramp / Interviewing.io** → mock interviews
* ✅ **NeetCode 150 / Blind 75** → redo *only tricky* ones
* ✅ **Behavioral Qs** — don’t skip them

## 🔁 Practice Strategy as a “Re-doer”

| Rule            | Tip                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Redo Smart      | Redo only those problems you couldn’t solve in < 30 min   |
| Add Constraints | Add "O(1) space" or "in-place" challenge to old problems  |
| Mix Topics      | Do problems where Tree + DP or Graph + Union Find combine |
| Time Yourself   | Aim to solve medium in 15–20 min, hard in 40–45           |
| Track Patterns  | Maintain a list of patterns that repeat across problems   |
