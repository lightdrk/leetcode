Here are several variations of the problem to challenge different aspects of the sliding window and subarray problems. Each variation requires a slightly different thought process or implementation tweak:

---

### **Variation 1: Minimum Average Subarray**
Instead of finding the **maximum average**, find the **minimum average** of a contiguous subarray of length \( k \).

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **minimum average value** and return this value.

---

### **Variation 2: Maximum Sum of Subarray**
Find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum sum**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), return the **maximum sum** of a contiguous subarray of length \( k \).

---

### **Variation 3: Subarray With Maximum Average Length Greater Than k**
Instead of fixing the subarray length to \( k \), find a contiguous subarray with length **greater than or equal to \( k \)** that has the **maximum average value**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray with length **greater than or equal to \( k \)** that has the **maximum average value** and return this value.

---

### **Variation 4: Weighted Average**
Each element in the subarray has a **weight** associated with it. The weight for each index is given in another array, `weights`. Find the subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum weighted average**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given two arrays `nums` and `weights` of equal length and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum weighted average**:
\[
\text{Weighted Average} = \frac{\text{sum}(\text{nums}[i:j] \times \text{weights}[i:j])}{k}
\]
Return this value.

---

### **Variation 5: Circular Array**
Consider the array as **circular**, meaning the last element wraps around to the first element. Find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum average value**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given a circular array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum average value**.

---

### **Variation 6: Maximum Product Subarray**
Find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum product**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum product** and return this value.

---

### **Variation 7: Subarray Average Closest to Target**
Find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) such that the **average value** is closest to a given target value.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, an integer \( k \), and a target value \( t \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) such that the average of the subarray is closest to \( t \).

---

### **Variation 8: Maximum Absolute Average Difference**
Find two contiguous subarrays of length \( k \) each, such that the **absolute difference** of their averages is maximized.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find two disjoint subarrays of length \( k \) each, such that the absolute difference between their averages is maximized.

---

### **Variation 9: Subarray Length Is a Range**
Instead of fixing the subarray length to \( k \), find a subarray with a length in the range \([k_{\text{min}}, k_{\text{max}}]\) that has the **maximum average value**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers \( k_{\text{min}} \) and \( k_{\text{max}} \), find a subarray with a length in the range \([k_{\text{min}}, k_{\text{max}}]\) that has the **maximum average value**.

---

### **Variation 10: Maximum Sum of Non-Overlapping Subarrays**
Find the maximum sum of \( m \) non-overlapping subarrays of length \( k \).

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, an integer \( k \), and \( m \), find \( m \) non-overlapping subarrays of length \( k \) such that their combined sum is maximized.

---

### **Variation 11: Multiple Arrays**
Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and an integer \( k \), find two contiguous subarrays of length \( k \)—one from each array—such that the sum of their averages is maximized.

#### Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` and an integer \( k \), find two contiguous subarrays of length \( k \) such that the combined average of the two subarrays is maximized.

---

### **Variation 12: Maximum XOR Subarray**
Find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum XOR value**.

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer \( k \), find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the **maximum XOR value** and return this value.

---

### **Variation 13: Sliding Window with Constraints**
Add constraints to the problem, such as:
- The subarray must not contain negative numbers.
- The subarray must have a sum less than a given value \( S \).

#### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, an integer \( k \), and a constraint \( S \), find a subarray of length \( k \) such that the average is maximized, and the subarray sum is less than \( S \).

---

These variations test different aspects of problem-solving, from sliding window techniques to incorporating additional constraints, and even combining multiple arrays or metrics. Let me know which one you'd like to explore!
