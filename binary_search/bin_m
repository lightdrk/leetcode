# 🔍 **Binary Search — Condition-Based Practice Problems**

These problems require identifying a *monotonic condition* and using binary search over the **answer space**, not indices.

---

## **LEVEL 1 — Warm-up (Straightforward Conditions)**

### **1. Square Root Ceiling**

Given an integer `n`, find the smallest integer `x` such that
`x*x >= n`.

---

### **2. First Bad Version**

You have a function `isBad(v)` that becomes true at some version and stays true afterwards.
Find the first bad version.

---

### **3. Min Speed to Arrive on Time**

Given an array of distances `dist[i]` and a time limit `H`, find the minimum integer speed `s` such that
`sum(ceil(dist[i] / s)) <= H`.

---

## **LEVEL 2 — Mid Difficulty**

### **4. Koko Eating Bananas**

Given piles of bananas and hours `H`, find the minimum eating speed so Koko finishes in time.

---

### **5. Allocate Minimum Pages**

Given `books[i]` as pages in each book and `k` students, split the array into `k` contiguous groups so the maximum pages assigned to any student is minimized.

Binary search on `maxPages`.

---

### **6. Ship Packages Within D Days**

Find the minimum ship capacity to deliver all packages within `D` days.

---

## **LEVEL 3 — Harder Conditions**

### **7. Minimize Maximum Difference of Pairs**

Given array `nums` and integer `p`, you must form `p` pairs minimizing the **maximum difference in each chosen pair**.
Binary search on `maxDiff`.

---

### **8. Split Array – Largest Sum**

Split array into `k` parts minimizing the **largest sum among parts**.

---

### **9. Find Smallest Value so That at Least k Pairs Have Difference ≤ x**

Given sorted `nums`, count pairs with `|nums[i] – nums[j]| ≤ x`.
Binary search on `x`.

---

## **LEVEL 4 — Very Hard**

### **10. Minimum Time to Finish Trips**

Given `time[i]` = time each bus takes for 1 trip.
If a bus can do infinite trips, find the minimum time so that total trips ≥ `T`.

Binary search on **time**.

---

### **11. Maximum Median with K Increments**

Find the maximum possible median if you can increment any elements up to `k` total.

Binary search on **median value**.

---

### **12. Peak Finder in 2D Grid (Binary Search on Rows with Condition)**

Given a grid, find a “peak”.
Binary search on mid-row, check max in that row, compare with neighbors.

Tell me one of these:

* **“Give me an easy problem to solve.”**
* **“Give me a medium one.”**
* **“Give me a hard one.”**
* **“Drill me with mixed random problems.”**

Or say: **“Start from Level X.”**

I can also give:
✔ step-by-step hints
