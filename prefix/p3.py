    ðŸ”· Problem: Count Number of Nice Subarrays

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
A nice subarray is a contiguous subarray that contains exactly k odd numbers.

Return the number of nice subarrays.

couldnt reach answer beacuse it does not work on [2,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2]
will not work on this whole as it breaks after getting odd = 3 we start decreasing it makingit so left never 0 
'''
for arr, k in test:
    print(func(arr,k))


'''
due to some guys comment , if we convert the whole array in to 1 and zero where 1 is for odd and 0 for even then promblem becomes , find the sub arrays where some of sub array equal to k ,, like i have done previously 

[0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
here prefix will be 3 on idx 6 
hash_map {0:-1,0,1,2}
hash_map {1:3}
hash_map {2: 5}
count = 4
we can add the len of array at 0 tocount 
{3:6}
count = 8
count = 12

correct answer

            prefix +=1
        if prefix-k in hash_map:
            count+=hash_map[prefix-k]
        hash_map[prefix] = hash_map.get(prefix,0) + 1
