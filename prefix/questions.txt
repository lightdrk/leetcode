To master **prefix sum** techniques, it's helpful to practice a variety of problems that cover different use cases and complexities. Here is a comprehensive list of **prefix sum** problems, ranging from easy to medium, to help you strengthen your understanding:

### **1. Basic Prefix Sum Problems**

#### 1.1 **Find the Sum of All Elements in an Array**
   - **Problem**: Given an array of integers, return the sum of all elements.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
     Output: 10
     ```
   - **Concept**: This is the simplest form of prefix sum. Just sum all the elements using a single pass.

#### 1.2 **Range Sum Query**
   - **Problem**: Given an array `nums` and two indices `i` and `j`, return the sum of the elements in the array between `i` and `j` (inclusive).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], i = 1, j = 3
     Output: 9  # sum of [2, 3, 4]
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use prefix sum to store cumulative sums and calculate the range sum in constant time.

### **2. Subarray Sum Problems**

#### 2.1 **Subarray Sum Equals K**
   - **Problem**: Given an array of integers and a target integer `k`, return the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [1, 1, 1], k = 2
     Output: 2
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use prefix sum and a hash map to store the cumulative sum and check for the presence of previous sums that satisfy the condition.

     Output: 9
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use a sliding window approach or prefix sum to calculate subarray sums efficiently.

#### 2.3 **Find Subarray with Sum Equal to Zero**
   - **Problem**: Given an array, find if there is a subarray whose sum equals zero.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [4, -2, 3, -3]
     Output: True  # subarray [4, -2, -2] sums to 0
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use prefix sum and a hash map to track sums and detect when a sum repeats (indicating a subarray with sum zero).

### **3. Range Query Problems**

#### 3.1 **Product of Array Except Self**
   - **Problem**: Given an array `nums`, return an array such that each element is the product of all the numbers in `nums` except itself.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
     Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use two prefix sum arrays to store the products on the left and right side of each element.

#### 3.2 **Range Sum Query (Immutable)**
   - **Problem**: Implement a class `NumArray` that supports the method `sumRange(i, j)` to return the sum of the elements between indices `i` and `j` (inclusive).
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]
     Output: numArray.sumRange(0, 2)  # Output: 1
     ```
   - **Concept**: Store prefix sums in an array to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.

### **4. Prefix Sum with Conditions**

#### 4.1 **Find Pivot Index**
   - **Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the index where the sum of elements to the left is equal to the sum of elements to the right.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]
     Output: 3
     ```
   - **Concept**: Calculate the total sum of the array. Then, iterate through the array, maintaining a left sum, and check if the condition holds at each index.

#### 4.2 **Count Subarrays with Sum Less than K**
   - **Problem**: Given an array and an integer `k`, count how many subarrays have a sum less than `k`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 10
     Output: 8  # subarrays are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use a sliding window or prefix sum approach to efficiently count the subarrays.

#### 4.3 **Find the Longest Subarray with Sum Equal to K**
   - **Problem**: Given an array, find the length of the longest subarray that sums to `k`.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3
     Output: 4  # subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] has sum 3
     ```
   - **Concept**: Use prefix sum with a hash map to track sums and their indices.

### **5. Advanced Problems Using Prefix Sum**

#### 5.1 **Maximum Difference Between Two Elements in an Array**
   - **Problem**: Given an array, find the maximum difference between two elements such that the larger element appears after the smaller one.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     Input: [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
     Output: 4  # difference between 5 and 1
     ```

     Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
     Output: [0, 6]
     ```
